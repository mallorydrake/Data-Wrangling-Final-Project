# BAIS:3250 Final Project
**Author(s):** Mallory Drake, Paige Turner, Luke Weeklund
 
**Description:**
In today’s competitive global job market, higher education institutions play a crucial role in shaping graduates’ career prospects and earning potential. Prospective students often consider factors such as academic reputation, global ranking, and potential future earnings when making their college choices. However, navigating through vast amounts of data to make informed decisions can be overwhelming, especially as many students move away from home for the first time. This project aims to analyze relationships between university rankings and the factors that contribute to these rankings such as graduates’ salaries, percentage of STEM majors at the university, and faculty ratings by integrating two real-world data sources.  

Through our analysis we hope to help prospective university students understand the reasons behind institutional rankings and how it will influence their financial compensation post-graduation. Not only will this information be helpful to students, but also to company hiring managers as they are looking through resumes and seeking out qualified individuals to hire.
